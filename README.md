Leaflet App where the user can click the "Random Maps" button to view a one of several maps randomly.  Currently the map app
will call one of several basemaps from a variety of sources (Stamen, OpenStreetMap, Esri, etc). Users can add more maps or
remove maps by adding additional tile sets in the code.
